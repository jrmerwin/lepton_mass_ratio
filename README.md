# The Standard Model as Vacuum Spectrogram:
## Deriving Lepton Mass Ratios from a 137-Bit Registry

February 2026

We present a framework in which the charged lepton mass hierarchy emerges as the spectral decomposition of a discrete 137-bit registry operating on a bipartite lattice. Three rules (split, sign-flip, sum) define a linear transfer matrix from which wave interference, a causal speed limit, and conservation laws arise without additional postulates. When signal density exceeds a saturation threshold $K = 1/130$, nodes freeze into reflective cavities whose eigenspectra determine particle masses. Lepton mass ratios are derived from the resonance frequencies of complete graphs: the electron corresponds to $K_3$ (the minimal resonant cavity), and the muon to $K_5$ (the 4-simplex, reflecting spacetime dimensionality), yielding $m_\mu/m_e = 3 \times 137/2 = 205.5$ (experimental: 206.77, accuracy 99.4\%). The tau mass follows from the substrate prime: $m_\tau/m_\mu = 17$, with $136 = 8 \times 17$ (experimental: 16.82, accuracy 98.9\%). A systematic uniqueness analysis over all integers $N = 10$ to $500$ demonstrates that $N = 137$ is the only value achieving $> 95\%$ combined accuracy across all three lepton ratios, with a 7.9 percentage point gap to the next candidate. The registry decomposition $137 = 130 + 7$ is shown to be constrained: 7 control bits constitute the minimum overhead for operating a bipartite lattice in three spatial dimensions. Lorentz contraction is derived analytically from bandwidth competition between structure maintenance and propagation, yielding $L(v)/L(0) = \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$ from information-theoretic arguments alone. The framework makes falsifiable predictions, including the absence of a fourth charged lepton generation and specific quark mass ratio structures.
